## Repo Structure

The the config repo must have a folder named "checklists" in the root.
The logo.png and options.yaml are optional.

If the logo.png or options.yaml are included, they must have those names exactly to be recognized by ghqc.

## Checklists

Checklists should be located in the checklists folder.
All checklists are yaml files with one of the following structures:

### Simple structure

The simple structure:
- begins with the name of the checklist to be displayed in `ghqc_assign_app()` as the key
- the value is a list of checklist items, each of which is prepended with a tick mark on a new line

### Header structure
yaml contents:
```
Report:
  Table of Contents:
    - depth of 2

  Body:
    - Page numbers exist on each page
    - Page numbers indicate total page length (e.g. Page 1 of 3)

  Tables and Figures:
    - Titles are correct
    - Captions are descriptive
    - Footnotes are accurate

  Appendix:

The header structure:
- begins with the name of the checklist to be displayed in `ghqc_assign_app()` as the key
- the value is a set of headers are given as keys themselves
- the value of each header key is a list of checklist items to appear under the header
- each checklist item is prepended with a tick mark on a new line

Extra considerations:
- Note: to include a colon in a checklist item, wrap it in quotation marks.\
  Example:
    ```
    - "the code is: readable, scalable, and documented"
    ```
- Note: to span a checklist item across multiple lines, begin the first line with the pipe operator, then start the checklist item contents on the next line.\
  Example:
  ```
